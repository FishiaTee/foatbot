# foatbot
A silly discord bot for FOAT, a joke server originated from GOAT

## Getting started
You will need to create a bot yourself. Instructions on how to do so can be found in the relevant [interactions.py guide](https://interactions-py.github.io/interactions.py/Guides/02%20Creating%20Your%20Bot/).

To run the bot, you will need Python 3.10 or newer installed. Install all required dependencies by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open `config.json` with your favorite text editor, and set the `token` property to your bot token that you've obtained while creating the bot earlier.

After that, run `foatbot.py` and the bot should start working, *hopefully*.

```sh
python3 foatbot.py
```
